# Apartment Rental Analysis Web App

## Abstract or Overview
This web app analyzes apartment rental prices across various locations, allowing users to filter by city, pets allowed, and price range. The app serves as a tool for individuals seeking rental apartments and property managers to understand market trends. It helps users easily find apartments matching their preferences.

## Audience
The target audience for my streamlit project is for apartment hunters so they can benefit from the tool by easily searching for rentals that fit their needs. A plus is that property managers can use the tool to analyze market trends, identify popular amenities, and set competitive prices.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains information on various apartments, including location, amenities, rental price, square footage, and other key features. The data was cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy and remove inconsistencies.

### Data Fields
- **Location**: City, State, Address, Latitude, Longitude

## Algorithm Description
The app is filtering data based on user-selected criteria, including city, pets allowed, and price range. Additional features like filtering by square footage and amenities, as well as visualization tools, may be implemented for enhanced usability.

## Tools Used
- **Streamlit**: Used to create the web app, providing an easy way to build interactive user interfaces.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and filtering operations.
- **Folium** (or **pydeck**): Optional, for map-based visualizations.
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for the backend logic.
- **GitHub**: Version control system used to track changes and collaborate.

## Ethical Concerns
Considering the sensitive nature of personal and location-based data, the following ethical considerations are addressed:
- **Privacy**: The data used does not contain personally identifiable information (PII) and respects user privacy.
- **Fairness**: The app does not discriminate against any group or individual based on their demographics.
